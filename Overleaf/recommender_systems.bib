The choices should be separated and focused on or altered so that the actual data is passed with significant subtleties to the service provider or to the intended user. A recommender framework or engine handles the information overload problem by customizing and filtering the large volume of data and generating the customer’s appropriate information dynamically with personalized content. This comprehensive study focuses on several recommender systems (RecSys) methodologies and discusses the problems or issues associated with different principles and techniques. In addition to the various principles and techniques, this study elaborates on several similarity measures, including conventional and non-conventional measures, with their merits and demerits also points out both ranking and non-ranking performance metrics. Further, we have studied different articles, including journals and conferences. Based on the studies, we outline current research challenges as future directions. We have briefly discussed various datasets utilized in the recommender domain for evaluating and validating the recommendation task.},

	abstract = {The music domain is among the most important ones for adopting recommender systems technology. In contrast to most other recommendation domains, which predominantly rely on collaborative filtering (CF) techniques, music recommenders have traditionally embraced content-based (CB) approaches. In the past years, music recommendation models that leverage collaborative and content data – which we refer to as content-driven models – have been replacing pure CF or CB models. In this survey, we review 55 articles on content-driven music recommendation. Based on a thorough literature analysis, we first propose an onion model comprising five layers, each of which corresponds to a category of music content we identified: signal, embedded metadata, expert-generated content, user-generated content, and derivative content. We provide a detailed characterization of each category along several dimensions. Second, we identify six overarching challenges, according to which we organize our main discussion: increasing recommendation diversity and novelty, providing transparency and explanations, accomplishing context-awareness, recommending sequences of music, improving scalability and efficiency, and alleviating cold start. Each article addresses one or more of these challenges and is categorized according to the content layers of our onion model, the article’s goal(s), and main methodological choices. Furthermore, articles are discussed in temporal order to shed light on the evolution of content-driven music recommendation strategies. Finally, we provide our personal selection of the persisting grand challenges which are still waiting to be solved in future research endeavors.},

For a quite long time, researchers and practitioners have been focusing on developing accurate RSs. Recent years have witnessed an increasing number of threats to RSs, coming from attacks, system and user generated noise, and various types of biases. As a result, it has become clear that the focus on RS accuracy is too narrow, and the research must consider other important factors, particularly trustworthiness. A trustworthy recommender system (TRS) should not only be accurate but also transparent, unbiased, fair, and robust to noise and attacks. These observations actually led to a paradigm shift of the research on RSs: from accuracy-oriented RSs to TRSs. However, there is a lack of a systematic overview and discussion of the literature in this novel and fast-developing field of TRSs. To this end, in this article, we provide an overview of TRSs, including a discussion of the motivation and basic concepts of TRSs, a presentation of the challenges in building TRSs, and a perspective on the future directions in this area. We also provide a novel conceptual framework to support the construction of TRSs.},

Since recommendations involve allocations of social resources (e.g., job recommendation), an important issue is whether recommendations are fair. Unfair recommendations are not only unethical but also harm the long-term interests of the recommender system itself. As a result, fairness issues in recommender systems have recently attracted increasing attention. However, due to multiple complex resource allocation processes and various fairness definitions, the research on fairness in recommendation is scattered. To fill this gap, we review over 60 papers published in top conferences/journals, including TOIS, SIGIR, and WWW. First, we summarize fairness definitions in the recommendation and provide several views to classify fairness issues. Then, we review recommendation datasets and measurements in fairness studies and provide an elaborate taxonomy of fairness methods in the recommendation. Finally, we conclude this survey by outlining some promising future directions.},

Humans perceive the world by processing the modality signals (e.g., audio, text and image), which inspired researchers to build a recommender system that can understand and interpret data from different modalities. Those models could capture the hidden relations between different modalities and possibly recover the complementary information which can not be captured by a uni-modal approach and implicit interactions. The goal of this survey is to provide a comprehensive review of the recent research efforts on the multimodal recommendation. Specifically, it shows a clear pipeline with commonly used techniques in each step and classifies the models by the methods used. Additionally, a code framework has been designed that helps researchers new in this area to understand the principles and techniques, and easily runs the SOTA models.

	abstract = {Recommender systems typically retrieve items from an item corpus for personalized recommendations. However, such a retrieval-based recommender paradigm faces two limitations: 1) the human-generated items in the corpus might fail to satisfy the users' diverse information needs, and 2) users usually adjust the recommendations via inefficient passive feedback, e.g., clicks. Nowadays, AI-Generated Content (AIGC) has revealed significant success, offering the potential to overcome these limitations: 1) generative AI can produce personalized items to satisfy users' information needs, and 2) the newly emerged large language models significantly reduce the efforts of users to precisely express information needs via natural language instructions. In this light, the boom of AIGC points the way towards the next-generation recommender paradigm with two new objectives: 1) generating personalized content through generative AI, and 2) integrating user instructions to guide content generation. To this end, we propose a novel Generative Recommender paradigm named GeneRec, which adopts an AI generator to personalize content generation and leverages user instructions. Specifically, we pre-process users' instructions and traditional feedback via an instructor to output the generation guidance. Given the guidance, we instantiate the AI generator through an AI editor and an AI creator to repurpose existing items and create new items. Eventually, GeneRec can perform content retrieval, repurposing, and creation to satisfy users' information needs. Besides, to ensure the trustworthiness of the generated items, we emphasize various fidelity checks. Moreover, we provide a roadmap to envision future developments of GeneRec and several domain-specific applications of GeneRec with potential research tasks. Lastly, we study the feasibility of implementing AI editor and AI creator on micro-video generation.},

In FEVR, we categorize the evaluation space of recommender systems evaluation. We postulate that the comprehensive evaluation of a recommender system frequently requires considering multiple facets and perspectives in the evaluation. The FEVR framework provides a structured foundation to adopt adequate evaluation configurations that encompass this required multi-facetedness and provides the basis to advance in the field.

With the latest advances in voice-controlled devices, natural language processing, and AI in general, such systems received increased attention in recent years. Technically, conversational recommenders are usually complex multi-component applications and often consist of multiple machine learning models and a natural language user interface. Evaluating such a complex system in a holistic way can therefore be challenging, as it requires (i) the assessment of the quality of the different learning components, and (ii) the quality perception of the system as a whole by users. Thus, a mixed methods approach is often required, which may combine objective (computational) and subjective (perception-oriented) evaluation techniques. In this paper, we review common evaluation approaches for conversational recommender systems, identify possible limitations, and outline future directions towards more holistic evaluation practices.},

	abstract = {Personalized PageRank is a variant of PageRank, widely developed for citation recommendation. However, the personalized PageRank that works with a vast amount and rich scholarly data still results in information overload. Sometimes, junior scholars still need help to arrange queries quickly because of limited domain knowledge. Senior researchers need reference papers regarding a similar topic they intend to search for and related topics as a new insight. In this research, scientific citation recommendation aims to find the most influential papers with similar and related topics. Related topic papers in serendipitous perspectives are reference papers that are novel, diversified and unexpected to a user. The unexpectedness of recommended papers can be papers with different topics to queries but still relevant. To accomplish these challenges, we propose a framework of scientific citation recommendation with serendipitous perspectives. The framework includes feature extraction of an academic citation network, selection of multi-topic communities, and ranking papers in the selected multi-topic communities by modified PageRank. Papers in the chosen communities tend to link to similar and related papers. Modified PageRank is an extension of personalized PageRank, which works on multi-topic communities and manuscript queries. The experiments reveal that the proposed models outperform some models of personalized PageRank and some models of Content-Based Filtering. The multi-topic communities-based models work more effectively than the baselines if they run in a large dataset since the topic communities become more cohesive.},

This paper proposes a novel approach for explaining content-based recommender systems by speciﬁcally focusing on publication venue recommendation. In this problem, the authors of a new research paper receive recommendations about possible journals (or other publication venues) to which they could submit their article based on content similarity, while the recommender system simultaneously explains its decisions. The proposed explanation ecosystem is based on various elements that support the explanation (topics, related articles, relevant terms, etc.) and is fully integrated with the underlying recommendation model. The proposed method is evaluated through a user study in the biomedical ﬁeld, where transparency, satisfaction, trust, and scrutability are assessed.

	abstract = {Today, recommender systems play a vital role in the acceleration of searches by internet users to find what they are interested in. Among the strategies proposed for recommender systems, collaborative filtering has received due attention regarding its simplicity and efficiency. The key factor for the success of this strategy returns to the similarity calculation methods that affect the accuracy of its recommendations. Regarding the large volume of articles published in the field of collaborative filtering for the development of recommender systems, it is necessary to provide a comprehensive review of the similarity functions and their efficiency presented in the field. Of course, several surveys have already been published to investigate the similarity functions proposed for collaborative filtering, but these articles either have looked briefly at these functions or reviewed a few numbers of them. In this study, the effort was to provide a comprehensive study on the similarity functions proposed for collaborative filtering with a special focus on the rating-based and neighbor-based approaches. After a brief explanation of each similarity function, some popular evaluation metrics were used for their evaluation using the MovieLens datasets. The comparative evaluation results presented in this article provide a highly useful reference for researchers in this field to choose their appropriate similarity function.},

	abstract = {The data sparsity is an acute challenge in most of the collaborative ﬁlterings (CFs) as their performance is affected by the known ratings of target users. Recently, active learning has become a prevalent and straight forward approach to cope with the data sparsity. In this approach, the newly entered users are requested to rate certain items while they signup to the underlying recommendation system. This work proposes an Enhanced Multistage User-based CF (EMUCF) algorithm, which uses the concept of active learning and predicts the unknown ratings for target users in two stages. Here, the anonymous ratings of each intermediary stage are predicted with traditional User\_CF algorithm. However, the similarity models commonly used in User\_CF are not adequate to compute the similarity among users. Therefore, the most recently introduced Bhattacharyya Coefﬁcient based nonlinear similarity model Bhat\_sim is used for similarity computations; it utilizes all rating pairs of items in the ﬁnal estimates of users similarities. Later, an extension of simple EMUCF, the (n {\textgreater} 2)-stage EMUCF is proposed to increase the prediction accuracy by progressively increasing the density of the original rating matrix. The performance of simple EMUCF and its extension is evaluated on two benchmark Movielens-100K and Movielens-1M datasets. They obtain far superior results for prediction accuracy and recommendation precision compared to several prominent competing algorithms. Finally, the potential improvement in the n-stage EMUCF algorithm is assessed by establishing the connection between rating prediction accuracy and matrix density. Ó 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Collaborative filtering (CF), one of the most widely employed methodologies for recommender systems, has drawn undeniable attention due to its effectiveness and simplicity. Nevertheless, a few papers have been published on the CF-based item-based model using similarity measures than the user-based model due to the model's complexity and the time required to build it. Additionally, the substantial shortcomings in the user-based measurements when the item-based model is taken into account motivated us to create stronger models in this work. Not to mention that the common trickiest challenge is dealing with the cold-start problem, in which users' history of item-buying behavior is missing (i.e., new users) or items for which activity is not provided (i.e., new items). Therefore, our novel five similarity measures, which have the potential to solve sparse data, are developed to alleviate the impact of this important problem. Most importantly, a thorough empirical analysis of how the item-based model affects the CF-based recommendation system’s performance has also been a critical part of this work, which presents a benchmarking study for thirty similarity metrics. The MAE, MSE, and accuracy metrics, together with fivefold cross-validation, are used to properly assess and examine the influence of all considered similarity measures using the Movie-lens 100 K and Film Trust datasets. The findings demonstrate how competitive the proposed similarity measures are in comparison to their alternatives. Surprisingly, some of the top "state-of-the-art" performers (such as SMD and NHSM) have been unable to fiercely compete with our proposed rivals when utilizing the item-based model.},

An established methodology in the literature based on matrix factorization (MF), which usually represents users and items as vectors in low-dimensional space, is an effective approach to recommender systems, thanks to its superior performance in terms of recommendation quality and scalability. A typical matrix factorization recommender system has two main phases: preference elicitation and recommendation retrieval. The former analyzes user-generated data to learn user preferences and item characteristics in the form of latent feature vectors, whereas the latter ranks the candidate items based on the learnt vectors and returns the top-k items from the ranked list. For preference elicitation, there have been numerous works to build accurate MF-based recommendation algorithms that can learn from large datasets. However, for the recommendation retrieval phase, naively scanning a large number of items to identify the few most relevant ones may inhibit truly real-time applications. In this work, we survey recent advances and state-of-the-art approaches in the literature that enable fast and accurate retrieval for MF-based personalized recommendations. Also, we include analytical discussions of approaches along different dimensions to provide the readers with a more comprehensive understanding of the surveyed works.},

The present paper introduces a recommender system for MaaS Plans selection that supports travelers to select bundles of mobility services that ﬁt their everyday transportation needs. The recommender ﬁlters out unsuitable plans and then ranks the remaining ones on the basis of their similarity to the users’ characteristics, habits and preferences. The recommendation approach is based on Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) formalisms combined with cosine similarity techniques. The proposed method was evaluated in experimental settings and was further embedded in real-life pilot MaaS applications. The experimental results showed that the proposed approach provides lists of MaaS PlanMaaS Plans that users would choose in a real-life MaaS setting, in most of the cases. Moreover, the results of the real-life pilots showed that the majority of the participants chose an actual MaaS Plan from the top three places of the recommendation lists.},

In recent years, session-based recommender systems (SBRSs) have emerged as a new paradigm of RSs. Different from other RSs such as content-based RSs and collaborative filtering-based RSs that usually model long-term yet static user preferences, SBRSs aim to capture short-term but dynamic user preferences to provide more timely and accurate recommendations sensitive to the evolution of their session contexts. Although SBRSs have been intensively studied, neither unified problem statements for SBRSs nor in-depth elaboration of SBRS characteristics and challenges are available. It is also unclear to what extent SBRS challenges have been addressed and what the overall research landscape of SBRSs is. This comprehensive review of SBRSs addresses the above aspects by exploring in depth the SBRS entities (e.g., sessions), behaviours (e.g., users’ clicks on items), and their properties (e.g., session length). We propose a general problem statement of SBRSs, summarize the diversified data characteristics and challenges of SBRSs, and define a taxonomy to categorize the representative SBRS research.

	abstract = {Automatic knowledge graph construction aims at manufacturing structured human knowledge. To this end, much effort has historically been spent extracting informative fact patterns from different data sources. However, more recently, research interest has shifted to acquiring conceptualized structured knowledge beyond informative data. In addition, researchers have also been exploring new ways of handling sophisticated construction tasks in diversified scenarios. Thus, there is a demand for a systematic review of paradigms to organize knowledge structures beyond data-level mentions. To meet this demand, we comprehensively survey more than 300 methods to summarize the latest developments in knowledge graph construction. A knowledge graph is built in three steps: knowledge acquisition, knowledge refinement, and knowledge evolution. The processes of knowledge acquisition are reviewed in detail, including obtaining entities with fine-grained types and their conceptual linkages to knowledge graphs; resolving coreferences; and extracting entity relationships in complex scenarios. The survey covers models for knowledge refinement, including knowledge graph completion, and knowledge fusion. Methods to handle knowledge evolution are also systematically presented, including condition knowledge acquisition, condition knowledge graph completion, and knowledge dynamic. We present the paradigms to compare the distinction among these methods along the axis of the data environment, motivation, and architecture. Additionally, we also provide briefs on accessible resources that can help readers to develop practical knowledge graph systems. The survey concludes with discussions on the challenges and possible directions for future exploration.},

Recently, graph neural networks have become the new state-of-the-art approach to recommender systems. In this survey, we conduct a comprehensive review of the literature on graph neural network-based recommender systems. We first introduce the background and the history of the development of both recommender systems and graph neural networks. For recommender systems, in general, there are four aspects for categorizing existing works: stage, scenario, objective, and application. For graph neural networks, the existing methods consist of two categories: spectral models and spatial ones. We then discuss the motivation of applying graph neural networks into recommender systems, mainly consisting of the high-order connectivity, the structural property of data and the enhanced supervision signal. We then systematically analyze the challenges in graph construction, embedding propagation/aggregation, model optimization, and computation efficiency. Afterward and primarily, we provide a comprehensive overview of a multitude of existing works of graph neural network-based recommender systems, following the taxonomy above. Finally, we raise discussions on the open problems and promising future directions in this area. We summarize the representative papers along with their code repositories in

Social media platforms are the most common internet applications due to the large number of users. The numerous posts, likes, etc. have accrued on social media platforms and can be used in variety of recommendation systems. In this work, the primary focus is the tourism domain, where RS serves as a valuable tool for the tourist to plan his trip. Traditional RS systems only cater to the needs of the tourist by examining few factors. However, there are a large range of factors such as environment factors , actual geo-coordinates, trip destination, preferences of the user etc. that need to be taken into account in order to make a foolproof recommendation to the tourists. Tourism Recommendation Systems (TRS) provide suggestions to the tourists to identify the most suited transport (flight, train, etc.), accommodations, museums, special interest places and other items which are required for the trip. Several techniques are used and a thorough study of various techniques of traditional RS and TRS techniques have been done which are specially designed for tourism domain. Various Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques have been highlighted which are used to solve the tourist recommendation problem. Also, future research direction has been suggested which would improvise the Quality of Service (QoS) of the RS in tourism industry.},

Self-supervised learning (SSL), as an emerging technique for learning from unlabeled data, has attracted considerable attention as a potential solution to this issue. This survey paper presents a systematic and timely review of research efforts on self-supervised recommendation (SSR). Specifically, we propose an exclusive definition of SSR, on top of which we develop a comprehensive taxonomy to divide existing SSR methods into four categories: contrastive, generative, predictive, and hybrid. For each category, we elucidate its concept and formulation, the involved methods, as well as its pros and cons. Furthermore, to facilitate empirical comparison, we release an open-source library SELFRec (https://github.com/Coder-Yu/SELFRec), which incorporates a wide range of SSR models and benchmark datasets. Through rigorous experiments using this library, we derive and report some significant findings regarding the selection of self-supervised signals for enhancing recommendation. Finally, we shed light on the limitations in the current research and outline the future research directions.},

	abstract = {Despite being studied for over twenty years, Recommender Systems (RSs) still suffer from important issues that limit their applicability in real-world scenarios. Data sparsity, cold start, and explainability are some of the most impacting problems. Intuitively, these historical limitations can be mitigated by injecting prior knowledge into recommendation models. Neuro-Symbolic (NeSy) approaches are suitable candidates for achieving this goal. Specifically, they aim to integrate learning (e.g., neural networks) with symbolic reasoning (e.g., logical reasoning). Generally, the integration lets a neural model interact with a logical knowledge base, enabling reasoning capabilities. In particular, NeSy approaches have been shown to deal well with poor training data, and their symbolic component could enhance model transparency. This gives insights that NeSy systems could potentially mitigate the aforementioned RSs limitations. However, the application of such systems to RSs is still in its early stages, and most of the proposed architectures do not really exploit the advantages of a NeSy approach. To this end, we conducted preliminary experiments with a Logic Tensor Network (LTN), a novel NeSy framework. We used the LTN to train a vanilla Matrix Factorization model using a First-Order Logic knowledge base as an objective. In particular, we encoded facts to enable the regularization of the latent factors using content information, obtaining promising results. In this paper, we review existing NeSy recommenders, argue about their limitations, show our preliminary results with the LTN, and propose interesting future works in this novel research area. In particular, we show how the LTN can be intuitively used to regularize models, perform cross-domain recommendation, ensemble learning, and explainable recommendation, reduce popularity bias, and easily define the loss function of a model.},

While Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have achieved significant advancements in enhancing recommender systems by modeling user-item interactions and incorporating their textual side information, these DNN-based methods still exhibit some limitations, such as difficulties in effectively understanding users’ interests and capturing textual side information, inabilities in generalizing to various seen/unseen recommendation scenarios and reasoning on their predictions, etc. Meanwhile, the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and GPT-4, has revolutionized the fields of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), due to their remarkable abilities in fundamental responsibilities of language understanding and generation, as well as impressive generalization capabilities and reasoning skills. As a result, recent studies have actively attempted to harness the power of LLMs to enhance recommender systems. Given the rapid evolution of this research direction in recommender systems, there is a pressing need for a systematic overview that summarizes existing LLM-empowered recommender systems, so as to provide researchers and practitioners in relevant fields with an in-depth understanding. Therefore, in this survey, we conduct a comprehensive review of LLM-empowered recommender systems from various aspects including pre-training, fine-tuning, and prompting paradigms. More specifically, we first introduce the representative methods to harness the power of LLMs (as a feature encoder) for learning representations of users and items. Then, we systematically review the emerging advanced techniques of LLMs for enhancing recommender systems from three paradigms, namely pre-training, fine-tuning, and prompting. Finally, we comprehensively discuss the promising future directions in this emerging field.},

	abstract = {Recently, there has been growing interest in developing the nextgeneration recommender systems (RSs) based on pretrained large language models (LLMs). However, the semantic gap between natural language and recommendation tasks is still not well addressed, leading to multiple issues such as spuriously correlated user/item descriptors, ineffective language modeling on user/item data, inefficient recommendations via auto-regression, etc. In this paper, we propose CLLM4Rec, the first generative RS that tightly integrates the LLM paradigm and ID paradigm of RSs, aiming to address the above challenges simultaneously. We first extend the vocabulary of pretrained LLMs with user/item ID tokens to faithfully model user/item collaborative and content semantics. Accordingly, a novel soft+hard prompting strategy is proposed to effectively learn user/item collaborative/content token embeddings via language modeling on RS-specific corpora, where each document is split into a prompt consisting of heterogeneous soft (user/item) tokens and hard (vocab) tokens and a main text consisting of homogeneous item tokens or vocab tokens to facilitate stable and effective language modeling. In addition, a novel mutual regularization strategy is introduced to encourage CLLM4Rec to capture recommendation-related information from noisy user/item content. Finally, we propose a novel recommendation-oriented finetuning strategy for CLLM4Rec, where an item prediction head with multinomial likelihood is added to the pretrained CLLM4Rec backbone to predict hold-out items based on soft+hard prompts established from masked user-item interaction history, where recommendations of multiple items can be generated efficiently without hallucination1.},

Consequently, the potential beneﬁts and implications of integrating FL with recommender systems are explored and an overview of FL, its types, and key components, are provided. Further, the privacy-preserving techniques inherent to FL are discussed, demonstrating how they contribute to secure recommender systems. By illustrating case studies and signiﬁcant research contributions, the article showcases the practical feasibility and beneﬁts of combining FL with recommender systems. Despite the promising beneﬁts, challenges, and limitations exist in the practical deployment of FL in recommender systems. This review outlines these hurdles, bringing to light the security considerations crucial in this context and offering a balanced perspective.

Our overarching question is how to ensure that recommender systems enact the values of the individuals and societies that they serve. Addressing this question in a principled fashion requires technical knowledge of recommender design and operation, and also critically depends on insights from diverse fields including social science, ethics, economics, psychology, policy, and law. This article is a multidisciplinary effort to synthesize theory and practice from different perspectives, with the goal of providing a shared language, articulating current design approaches, and identifying open problems. We collect a set of values that seem most relevant to recommender systems operating across different domains, and then examine them from the perspectives of current industry practice, measurement, product design, and policy approaches. Important open problems include multi-stakeholder processes for defining values and resolving trade-offs, better values-driven measurements, recommender controls that people use, non-behavioral algorithmic feedback, optimization for long-term outcomes, causal inference of recommender effects, academic-industry research collaborations, and interdisciplinary policy-making.},

	abstract = {Recommender systems have become crucial in information filtering nowadays. Existing recommender systems extract user preferences based on the correlation in data, such as behavioral correlation in collaborative filtering, feature-feature, or feature-behavior correlation in click-through rate prediction. However, unfortunately, the real world is driven by
              causality
              , not just correlation, and correlation does not imply causation. For instance, recommender systems might recommend a battery charger to a user after buying a phone, where the latter can serve as the cause of the former; such a causal relation cannot be reversed. Recently, to address this, researchers in recommender systems have begun utilizing causal inference to extract causality, thereby enhancing the recommender system. In this survey, we offer a comprehensive review of the literature on causal inference-based recommendation. Initially, we introduce the fundamental concepts of both recommender system and causal inference as the foundation for subsequent content. We then highlight the typical issues faced by non-causality recommender system. Following that, we thoroughly review the existing work on causal inference-based recommender systems, based on a taxonomy of three-aspect challenges that causal inference can address.

	abstract = {Recommender systems play a significant role in information filtering and have been utilized in different scenarios, such as e-commerce and social media. With the prosperity of deep learning, deep recommender systems show superior performance by capturing non-linear information and item-user relationships. However, the design of deep recommender systems heavily relies on human experiences and expert knowledge. To tackle this problem, Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) is introduced to automatically search for the proper candidates for different parts of deep recommender systems. This survey performs a comprehensive review of the literature in this field. Firstly, we propose an abstract concept for AutoML for deep recommender systems (AutoRecSys) that describes its building blocks and distinguishes it from conventional AutoML techniques and recommender systems. Secondly, we present a taxonomy as a classification framework containing feature selection search, embedding dimension search, feature interaction search, model architecture search, and other components search. Furthermore, we put a particular emphasis on the search space and search strategy, as they are the common thread to connect all methods within each category and enable practitioners to analyze and compare various approaches. Finally, we propose four future promising research directions that will lead this line of research.},

	abstract = {Recommender systems have been widely deployed in various real-world applications to help users identify content of interest from massive amounts of information. Traditional recommender systems work by collecting user-item interaction data in a cloud-based data center and training a centralized model to perform the recommendation service. However, such cloud-based recommender systems (CloudRSs) inevitably suffer from excessive resource consumption, response latency, as well as privacy and security risks concerning both data and models. Recently, driven by the advances in storage, communication, and computation capabilities of edge devices, there has been a shift of focus from CloudRSs to on-device recommender systems (DeviceRSs), which leverage the capabilities of edge devices to minimize centralized data storage requirements, reduce the response latency caused by communication overheads, and enhance user privacy and security by localizing data processing and model training. Despite the rapid rise of DeviceRSs, there is a clear absence of timely literature reviews that systematically introduce, categorize and contrast these methods. To bridge this gap, we aim to provide a comprehensive survey of DeviceRSs, covering three main aspects: (1) the deployment and inference of DeviceRSs (2) the training and update of DeviceRSs (3) the security and privacy of DeviceRSs. Furthermore, we provide a fine-grained and systematic taxonomy of the methods involved in each aspect, followed by a discussion regarding challenges and future research directions. This is the first comprehensive survey on DeviceRSs that covers a spectrum of tasks to fit various needs. We believe this survey will help readers effectively grasp the current research status in this field, equip them with relevant technical foundations, and stimulate new research ideas for developing DeviceRSs.},

	abstract = {Recommender systems (RSs)
              have become an inseparable part of our everyday lives. They help us find our favorite items to purchase, our friends on social networks, and our favorite movies to watch. Traditionally, the recommendation problem was considered to be a classification or prediction problem, but it is now widely agreed that formulating it as a sequential decision problem can better reflect the user-system interaction. Therefore, it can be formulated as a
              Markov decision process (MDP)
              and be solved by
              reinforcement learning (RL)
              algorithms. Unlike traditional recommendation methods, including collaborative filtering and content-based filtering, RL is able to handle the sequential, dynamic user-system interaction and to take into account the long-term user engagement. Although the idea of using RL for recommendation is not new and has been around for about two decades, it was not very practical, mainly because of scalability problems of traditional RL algorithms. However, a new trend has emerged in the field since the introduction of
              deep reinforcement learning (DRL)
              , which made it possible to apply RL to the recommendation problem with large state and action spaces. In this paper, a survey on
              reinforcement learning based recommender systems (RLRSs)
              is presented. Our aim is to present an outlook on the field and to provide the reader with a fairly complete knowledge of key concepts of the field. We first recognize and illustrate that RLRSs can be generally classified into RL- and DRL-based methods. Then, we propose an RLRS framework with four components, i.e., state representation, policy optimization, reward formulation, and environment building, and survey RLRS algorithms accordingly. We highlight emerging topics and depict important trends using various graphs and tables. Finally, we discuss important aspects and challenges that can be addressed in the future.},

Over the past two decades, explainable recommendation has attracted much attention in the recommender systems research community. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of research efforts on visual explanation in recommender systems. More concretely, we systematically review the literature on explanations in recommender systems based on four dimensions, namely explanation aim, explanation scope, explanation method, and explanation format. Recognizing the importance of visualization, we approach the recommender system literature from the angle of explanatory visualizations, that is using visualizations as a display style of explanation. As a result, we derive a set of guidelines that might be constructive for designing explanatory visualizations in recommender systems and identify perspectives for future work in this field. The aim of this review is to help recommendation researchers and practitioners better understand the potential of visually explainable recommendation research and to support them in the systematic design of visual explanations in current and future recommender systems.},

	abstract = {Social recommender systems (SocialRS) simultaneously leverage the user-to-item interactions as well as the user-to-user social relations for the task of generating item recommendations to users. Additionally exploiting social relations is clearly effective in understanding users’ tastes due to the effects of homophily and social influence. For this reason, SocialRS has increasingly attracted attention. In particular, with the advance of graph neural networks (GNN), many GNN-based SocialRS methods have been developed recently. Therefore, we conduct a comprehensive and systematic review of the literature on GNN-based SocialRS.
            
              In this survey, we first identify 84 papers on GNN-based SocialRS after annotating 2,151 papers by following the PRISMA framework (preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses). Then, we comprehensively review them in terms of their inputs and architectures to propose a novel taxonomy: (1) input taxonomy includes five groups of input type notations and seven groups of input representation notations; (2) architecture taxonomy includes eight groups of GNN encoder notations, two groups of decoder notations, and 12 groups of loss function notations. We classify the GNN-based SocialRS methods into several categories as per the taxonomy and describe their details. Furthermore, we summarize benchmark datasets and metrics widely used to evaluate the GNN-based SocialRS methods. Finally, we conclude this survey by presenting some future research directions.

	abstract = {People usually have the explicit or implicit desire to get the information they need and are most interested in from massive information, which has led to the creation of personalized recommender systems. Recommender systems are set up to address the issue of information overload in traditional information retrieval systems such as search engines, and have been a significant area of research focused on recommending information that is of most interest to users. There is a sequential nature to the behavior of a person interacting with a system, such as examining one item of clothing before examining others. The problem of taking this sequential nature into account in delivering recommendation is known as sequential recommendation (SR). The traditional sequential recommendation problem merely takes into account a single type of behavior of the users, while in real scenarios users tend to engage in multiple types of behaviors, such as examining and adding clothes to cart before purchasing them, leading to the proposal of multibehavior sequential recommendation (MBSR). MBSR considers both sequentiality and heterogeneity of user behaviors, which can achieve state-of-the-art recommendation through suitable modeling. Hence, MBSR is a relatively new and worthy direction for in-depth research, for which some related works have been proposed. This survey aims to shed light on the MBSR problem. Firstly, we introduce MBSR in detail, including its problem definition, application scenarios and challenges faced. Secondly, we detail the classification of MBSR, including neighborhood-based methods, matrix factorization-based methods and deep learningbased methods, where we further classify the deep learningbased methods into different learning architectures based on RNN, GNN, Transformer, and generic architectures as well as architectures that integrate hybrid techniques. In each method, we present related works based on the data perspective and the modeling perspective, as well as analyze the strengths, weaknesses and features of these works. Finally, we discuss some promising future research directions to address the challenges and improve the current status of MBSR.},

              recommender system (RS)
              , most of the papers focus on inventing machine learning models to better fit user behavior data. However, user behavior data is observational rather than experimental. This makes various biases widely exist in the data, including but not limited to selection bias, position bias, exposure bias, and popularity bias. Blindly fitting the data without considering the inherent biases will result in many serious issues, e.g., the discrepancy between offline evaluation and online metrics, hurting user satisfaction and trust on the recommendation service, and so on. To transform the large volume of research models into practical improvements, it is highly urgent to explore the impacts of the biases and perform debiasing when necessary. When reviewing the papers that consider biases in RS, we find that, to our surprise, the studies are rather fragmented and lack a systematic organization. The terminology “bias” is widely used in the literature, but its definition is usually vague and even inconsistent across papers. This motivates us to provide a systematic survey of existing work on RS biases. In this paper, we first summarize seven types of biases in recommendation, along with their definitions and characteristics. We then provide a taxonomy to position and organize the existing work on recommendation debiasing. Finally, we identify some open challenges and envision some future directions, with the hope of inspiring more research work on this important yet less investigated topic.

We then explore state-of-the-art methods in each category, including fraudster detection, adversarial training, certifiable robust training against malicious attacks, and regularization, purification, self-supervised learning against natural noise. Additionally, we summarize evaluation metrics and common datasets used to assess robustness. We discuss robustness across varying recommendation scenarios and its interplay with other properties like accuracy, interpretability, privacy, and fairness. Finally, we delve into open issues and future research directions in this emerging field.

We also show that RBM’s slightly outperform carefully-tuned SVD models.

	abstract = {Automatic music recommendation has become an increasingly relevant problem in recent years, since a lot of music is now sold and consumed digitally. Most recommender systems rely on collaborative ﬁltering. However, this approach suffers from the cold start problem: it fails when no usage data is available, so it is not effective for recommending new and unpopular songs. In this paper, we propose to use a latent factor model for recommendation, and predict the latent factors from music audio when they cannot be obtained from usage data. We compare a traditional approach using a bag-of-words representation of the audio signals with deep convolutional neural networks, and evaluate the predictions quantitatively and qualitatively on the Million Song Dataset. We show that using predicted latent factors produces sensible recommendations, despite the fact that there is a large semantic gap between the characteristics of a song that affect user preference and the corresponding audio signal. We also show that recent advances in deep learning translate very well to the music recommendation setting, with deep convolutional neural networks signiﬁcantly outperforming the traditional approach.},
